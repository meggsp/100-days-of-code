# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 25, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Gone through 14 parts of the Data Visualisation with D3 exercises. 1h 40m.

**Thoughts:** Very enjoyable, albeit at bits confusing. Syntax in the exercises doesn't always fit as the console may show an error. Must remember to breath though. Good to finally start touching on this stuff.

### Day 2: January 26th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Data Visualisation D3 exercises. Taken two hours.

**Thoughts**: It really got challenging, but most of the 'mistakes' seem to have been simple syntax errors. Like not closing a bracket enough times. Good to finish it though.

### Day 3: January 27th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed both data-visualisation and the JSON tutorials. Now onto the actual exercise.

**Thoughts**: We'll see once I go through the challenge (;-))

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 4: January 28th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started on the bar exercise. Finding it quite the challenge, but then again I'm getting used to the codepen interface and sometimes it flags errors where it shouldn't, like telling you a class doesn't exist or semi-colon, when you're literally about to insert it. I've copied some code from the 'example' exercise but need to work it out step by step. 

**Thoughts**: Try again tomorrow, then if struggling, consult help.
