# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 25, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Gone through 14 parts of the Data Visualisation with D3 exercises. 1h 40m.

**Thoughts:** Very enjoyable, albeit at bits confusing. Syntax in the exercises doesn't always fit as the console may show an error. Must remember to breath though. Good to finally start touching on this stuff.

**Link to work:** (havent sussed this bit out yet)
### Day 2: January 26th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Data Visualisation D3 exercises. Taken two hours.

**Thoughts**: It really got challenging, but most of the 'mistakes' seem to have been simple syntax errors. Like not closing a bracket enough times. Good to finish it though.

### Day 3: January 27th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed both data-visualisation and the JSON tutorials. Now onto the actual exercise.

**Thoughts**: We'll see once I go through the challenge (;-))

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 4: January 28th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started on the bar exercise. Finding it quite the challenge, but then again I'm getting used to the codepen interface and sometimes it flags errors where it shouldn't, like telling you a class doesn't exist or semi-colon, when you're literally about to insert it. I've copied some code from the 'example' exercise but need to work it out step by step. 

**Thoughts**: Try again tomorrow, then if struggling, consult help.

### Day 5: January 31st, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Got a bit futher with the first exercise, but as the brain is a little clogged (it happens) I'll leave it to an hour or so today and do some more tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: Glad that I got a little further, it'll be good when it's fully done.

### Day 6: February 1st, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Decided to do some of the 'earlier' stuff to do with html/css, in order to get some actual tests done. Please note, I have not gone ahead with formatting, only to get the tests to pass.

**Thoughts**: 1 hour a day is good to get your focus on with a cup of tea/coffee. I've also now worked out how to see the 'failed' tests, which makes things a little clearer.

### Day 7: February 2nd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Responsive Web Design tasks and earned the certificate.

**Thoughts**: Glad to finish it. Now onto the further challenges. Note - I didn't apply any real styling like the examples have suggested, as I already know how to style elements. If this is required at a later time, I will do it.

What's incredibly frustrating is sometimes the actual 'solutions' are different to the examples. So it sometimes throws you off. Then you have to have a look at the answer. 

**Thoughts**: Bit of an anxious day today, furthermore by solutions being different from examples. So done an hour. Going to try make a small python game later.

### Day 14: February 9th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Onto the Python tutorials. Videos are useful. #2hrs https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/python-for-everybody/more-conditional-structures

**Thoughts**: Nice to be learning it, albeit I know bits. Been looking at game code also - have a minor idea.
