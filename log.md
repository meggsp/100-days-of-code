# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 25, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Gone through 14 parts of the Data Visualisation with D3 exercises. 1h 40m.

**Thoughts:** Very enjoyable, albeit at bits confusing. Syntax in the exercises doesn't always fit as the console may show an error. Must remember to breath though. Good to finally start touching on this stuff.

### Day 2: January 26th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Data Visualisation D3 exercises. Taken two hours.

**Thoughts**: It really got challenging, but most of the 'mistakes' seem to have been simple syntax errors. Like not closing a bracket enough times. Good to finish it though.
